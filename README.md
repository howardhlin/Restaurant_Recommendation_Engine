The highly competitive social media market and the vast choices of online review platforms have urged websites like Yelp.com to find a more advanced algorithm to target their customer. In this project, my teammates and I aimed to introduce a recommendation engine for Yelp that could more accurately target users for the local merchants. Given a business name, our algorithm generates a list of users as ad audience for that business. The algorithm is based on clustering and content-based filtering.

Our project has following workflow:

1. Data Preprocessing
2. Data Modeling: K-means Clustering and Cosine Similarity method
3. Recommendation Engine: model training and result validation

The step 1 is included in the file "Data_Preprocessing". The step 2 and step 3 are included in the file "Yelp_Recommendation_Engine".
