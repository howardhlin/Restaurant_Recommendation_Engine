# Restaurant_Recommendation_System

The highly competitive social media market and the vast choices of online review platforms have urged websites like Yelp.com to find more advanced algorithms to target their customers. In this project, my teammates and I introduced a recommendation engine for Yelp that could more accurately target users for the local merchants. Our engine generates a targeted list of users for a specific business based on clustering and content-based filtering.

Our project has following workflow:

1. Data Preprocessing
2. Data Modeling: K-means Clustering and Cosine Similarity method
3. Recommendation Engine: model training and result validation

The step 1 is included in the file "Data_Preprocessing". The step 2 and 3 are included in "Yelp_Recommendation_Engine".
